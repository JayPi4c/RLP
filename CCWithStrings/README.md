# CCWithStrings 
This version of the Collatz Conjecture on an Arduino deals or calculates with Strings instead of the datatype long because 
the range of a long is limited. Calculating with strings allows the calculation up to infinity. 
There are other versions of the calculating of the Collatz Conjecture in this repo also for the Arduino.
